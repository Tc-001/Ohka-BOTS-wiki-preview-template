Designed for mobility in combat, Surges become extremely fast and deadly as they grow more powerful. They may have the lowest health and base damage of the BOTS, but they deal the most ranged damage, excel at pushing due to their speed and can attack enemies with the least amount of risk when piloted well. Surges excel in various areas, such as maps that where they can push enemies or gun down key targets. They are a nuisance in PvP & Base due to being hard to catch and can be untouchable when mastered.

## Abilities
- Surge Heads uniquely boost their Evade stat. Surges can occasionally dodge so many attacks in a row that they might have been destroyed had they been another BOT.
- Surge Bodies uniquely boost their Speed stat. A powerful Surge zooms around the battlefield, dictating when and where the fight takes place.
- Surge Arms uniquely boost their RangedAttack stat. For what they lack in melee damage, Surges make up for in firepower.

## Roles
### Sector
Surges may feel difficult to less experienced players due to their base damage being the lowest of the BOTS. However with their speed, they are able to manipulate the AI of Viruses much more easily than the other classes. Surges can zoom from edge to edge, bringing Viruses to an easy push before racing to the next area. They also deal significant damage to key targets with their guns, so they must choose when to use their limited ammo wisely.

### PvP
Surges are masters of the hit-and-run combat style and thus prediction and careful timing is needed to deal with them in PvP. A good Surge will knock their enemies down and be gone before there's a chance of retaliation, and repeat this until their opponents are worn down into kill range.

### Base
Surges can take on numerous roles such as pushing enemy mercenaries, defense, and support due to their speed, which can make them difficult to lock down. They usually use a 3/3 TD coin set and from there either use TD shield/shoulder to further increase their bulk or TG shield/shoulder to become efficient mercenary-killing machines. They can also deal decent damage to enemy bases with their guns if they can hold good positioning for long enough. Surges don't really have great weaknesses in BvB, but can only excel at one or two roles at any given time when played masterfully -- else they will simply be using their speed to glide into quicker deaths. The biggest weakness of Surges include low base damage, especially since they do not usually invest in TA. As such, they are rarely a direct threat to the enemy base. This can make Surges passive if played incorrectly.
