# Skins System
Our skins system is a never-before-seen feature amongst BOTS servers. Skins come as coupons that need to be activated. Skins can be obtained in various ways, some can be purchased from the shop and some only drop from playing. Note that you can `Use` the coupon, but you need to own the permanent version of the item, in order to `Swap` to one of its available skins. Most skin coupons share the same icon, but there are some exceptions.

<br/>

## Use Button
The `Use` button can be found in `My Info` & `Shop`.

To activate an item, select an item in your inventory and then click `Use` and the item will be consumed. Currently used for skin items listed below.
>SCRAP boxes will be moved to this feature soon!

<br/>

## Swap System
The `Swap` button can be found in the `My Info` screen. You can use this system to swap back and forth between skins! Selecting an item and clicking `Swap` will open a menu letting you change it out with other item variants you've unlocked.
