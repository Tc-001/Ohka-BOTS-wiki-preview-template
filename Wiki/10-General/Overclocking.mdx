# Overclock
Overclocking is the games prestige system that allows you to reset your level back to 1 from 100 with an upgrade from the shop. Each time you Overclock, you gain increasing Experience up to a cap of five upgrades. Past that, the level cap for Overclocking is Overclock 100. Reaching your first Overclock will also unlock in-game features such as trading, gifting and the Marketplace.

You can Overclock further to access more powerful items in the Overclock shop, including powerful Mercenaries and Transformation Packs as well as quality-of-life items such as long-term Skill Packs, discounted Consumables and upgrades that automatically sell the more common items as you find them. Overclocked players can wear items without level restrictions and can go back and level through all of the early and midgame maps, like a New Game+.

You can also increase your Overclock with an Overclock++ coupon, an incredibly rare item that can be found in any Sector map. Use Overclock++ to gain another Overclock but keep your level 100.
