# Partying Up
Rooms allow for up to 8 players to play together, and increased party sizes have effects on gameplay elements. Enemies in Sector rooms have regular health for 1-2 players, 20% bonus health for 3-4 players, 40% bonus health for 5-6 players, and 60% health for 7-8 players. For Experience rates, each player increases the rates by 8% per player in Sector and 20% per player in PvP, BvB and Strikes. For item drops in Sector, each player adds 1 additional drop chance per miniboss and 2 additional drops for final bosses, up to a max of 5 players.
