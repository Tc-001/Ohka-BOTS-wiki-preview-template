# Guilds
Guilds are social groups for people who want to have fun while playing Ohka BOTS together! You need to be at least `Level 30 and hold at least 10,000 Gigas` in order to create a Guild. Guild name has to be at least `4 characters` long. Membership is by `invitation` or `application` only, there is no minimum level requirement to join. As a member of a guild you can easily chat with other guild members and find friends for our Multi-Player content. All guilds have one Guild Leader, who may assign a `Co-Leader`. Guilds start out with `10` member slots, it can be upgraded to `20` slots. Guild members gain Guild Points from completing various PvE modes.
Guilds have a ranking page, TOP Guilds are determined by the amount of total Guild Points. We also have a Guild Point tracker, which tracks each members Weekly and Monthly gained Guild Points. Weekly tracker resets every `Monday` whilst Monthly resets on the `1st` of every Month. There's also an additional party bonus xp of `2%` for every other Guild Member in the room including yourself.
