Crafting is used with Crafting Coupons & Combination Coupons to combine together Fragments to create full items. This is typically done with much rarer items in the endgame with endgame Energy Fields being the main example. For whatever item you need crafted, collect three of the same Fragments, place them into the combination menu of the My Info/Shop interface and combine them with a coupon to fully create the item you need. Its wiser to use Combination Coupons for XMOG'ing and Crafting Coupons for Fragments.
