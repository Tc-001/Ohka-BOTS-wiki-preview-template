Sector is the cooperated story-based PvE mode of Ohka BOTS where players take on the Viruses threatening to consume Cyberspace. Bring a team of up to 8 players, with each player adding to the health pool of the Viruses. There are over 30 Sector maps with varying enemies and loot to collect. In Sector, you are able to summon your first-slot mercenary to assist you if you have bought one for Coins or unboxed a mercenary's coin version. You can defeat Viruses by reducing their health to zero or by pushing them off of edges, making some maps more ideal for either playstyle.
Elite maps are modified versions of other maps with increased difficulty and drop chances.
