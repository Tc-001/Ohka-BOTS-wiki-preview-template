## Antivirus

As many of you will soon notice, certain Antivirus programs (especially Microsoft's Windows Defender) don't like some files in our game. Namely, they believe `ohka.dat`, `ohkapatcher.exe` and `ohkapatcher.dmy` to be malicious files. In truth this is a false-positive result as these files modify an active process in the memory - the game itself - and any antivirus will believe that this is a threat. Be sure to make backups of these files, or re-run the installer again, after you have excluded the folder.  
**The way to go around this** (apart from deactivating your Antivirus - which we don't recommend), is adding the game folder to the exception list of your Antivirus. You can find detailed steps on Google or below:
